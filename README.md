# Quizzer

Take on your friends in a quiz game.

Create a quiz with your own questions and act as quizmaster while your friends battle it out for first place.

The idea for this stemmed from the lockdown-induced Zoom quizzes of March/April 2020. The app is designed to be played with the quizmaster talking to participants, and eases the hassle of collecting answers and correcting.

## Details

Angular frontend which connects to a [backend](https://github.com/gniall12/quiz-backend) written in Python using Flask

## Running Code

Set up Angular using the steps [here](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local)

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
